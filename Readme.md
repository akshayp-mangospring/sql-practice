# Practice on a Single Table
- To get started load the db by running the following command in SQL shell:
```
source absolute/path/to/books/book_shop.sql
```
- Then you can fire queries on that DB.
- The rest of the files have queries fired on that DB. They can be loaded in the same way as `book_shop.sql`
